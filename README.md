## About Jiaying (Tina)
Hi, I'm Jiaying Chen. I go by Tina most of the time. I'm an undergrad student studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics at College of William & Mary graduating in May 2022. I'm passionate about solving people's pain points through programing and analytics. In Summer 2021, I worked at Millennium Manangement as a Software Engineer Intern and I'm currenly looking for 2022 Software Engineer full-time opportunities. In my free time, I enjoy city hikes, kickboxing, watching movies, and exploring indie bands.
