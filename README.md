## About Jiaying
Hi, I'm Jiaying Chen. I'm an undergrad student studying Applied Math and Computer Science at College of William & Mary. I'm passionate about data science and I do data analysis and modeling primarily in Python and R. Besides data science, I enjoy photography, cooking, city hikes and watching standup comedies.
